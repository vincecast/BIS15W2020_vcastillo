## Welcome!

## About Me
I am from Southern California but migrated up to Davis in order to attend university! Some things I enjoy doing on my free time is surfing and playing video games!

## Favorite Food
My favorite plate is a Mexican soup called Menudo! Sadly I don't know how to make it good for myself, so I am only able to eat it when visiting home :(
